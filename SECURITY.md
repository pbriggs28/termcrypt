## Vulnerabilities

If you find a vulnerability in our application, create an issue in the issues section on our repository.

If the vulnerability is serious, you should expect prompt updates from us.

If a vulnerability is fixed, you can expect its fix in the upcoming release.

## Safety

Even though we take security very seriously, there is a small chance that due to accidental malpractice in development that vunerabilties could be introduced, therefore we cannot provide any compensation. If a serious vunerability is found, we will notify people using the app in every way possible.

However, as described below, we want to rely on as little third party packages and site requests as possible to minimize the chance of malicious attacks.

## Privacy

The termcrypt organization takes privacy very seriously. The only requests we currently send as of writing are to the needed exchange apis, to improve privacy and security. Privacy is an underrated human right and we will cease to be a free project.

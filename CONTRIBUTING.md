## Contributing
When contributing to termcrypt, we expect that your code is made to fit the following terms:
- Must follow code naming schemes
- Must follow common code linting / syntax
- Must not introduce any vunerabilities or third party reliances

Also you should not use the github website to create a pull request.

Instead, use `git` and `gh` in the terminal locally to open a pull request.

Other than that, we highly appreciate pull requests that contribute to our free project and we will give feedback on pull requests if they do not fit these terms or other conditions.
